This repository contains my portfolio in html document named Portfolio as well as a refactored html file which are in the folders Porfolio and horiseon respectively. The purpose of refactoring the file was to improve code readability which is a typical task done by developers.
These projects are part of my own portfolio that prospects employeers can review.

Visual Studio Code 1.67.1 was used to modify and/or create the files. Each folder contains all the files to render the webpage that is within each folder.
