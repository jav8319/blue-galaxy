This repository contains a refactored html file. The purpose of refactoring the file was to improve code readability which is a typical task done by developers.
This project is the first step to build my own portfolio that prospects emplyeers can review.

Visual Studio Code 1.67.1 was used to modify the original file. The refactored file is named index.html and is located in the folder named horiseon which also contains
all the files index.html uses to render the webpage
